## Known Issues

| Status | Issue | Description | Priority | Target Date |
|--------|-------|-------------|----------|------------|
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Delete events not always received | Delete events are not consistently triggered during testing, especially in the emulator environment. This affects document deletion notifications in nested collection patterns. | Medium | TBD |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è | Node displays as "Firestore" instead of "Firestore Trigger" | In the n8n UI, the node appears as "Firestore" rather than "Firestore Trigger" in the node selection menu. This is a cosmetic issue and doesn't affect functionality. | Low | TBD |
